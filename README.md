# material_house.

Materials and objects inside a house defined using Dart's OOP.

The purpose of this repository is to define typical household objects, and its interactions between each others,
whilst learning how to use Dart's Object Oriented Programming.

Feel free to make a contribution to this repository; only basic knowledge of Dart is required. The rest of the requirement is to have fun! =)
